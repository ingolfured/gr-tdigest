# 🚀 Future Improvements

Here are some ideas and goals to make tdigest-rs even better:

- **Guard against overflowing weight:**
	Ensure that centroid weights never overflow, for robust and safe calculations.

- **No memory leaks in CDF or mass quantile calculations:**
	Make sure all memory is properly managed during CDF and quantile computations, keeping things efficient and reliable.
